Prerequisites
Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.
Python Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Install the necessary libraries (Open powershell as an administrator then come to this folder and paste the velow comand)
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib



Prepare a CSV file with the data.
Read the CSV file using pandas.
Train-Test Split for the data.
Model Training, Testing, Evaluation using scikit-learn.
Plot the results for visualization.

Model Training & Evaluation:

The LinearRegression model is trained using the CSV data.
The model is then evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Visualization:

The actual vs predicted values are plotted to help visualize how well the model fits the data.
Prediction on New Data:

You can test the model on new data points to predict house prices for houses with 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 rooms.

Expected Ressults
Expected Output
The terminal will display the first 5 rows of the dataset to ensure the data is loaded properly.
It will print the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) of the model.
The script will display a plot showing the actual vs. predicted house prices.
You will see the model summary including the intercept and coefficient, as well as the final equation of the line.
Lastly, predictions for new data points (houses with 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 rooms) will be printed.
